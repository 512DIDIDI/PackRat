These components help you follow best practices, free you from writing boilerplate code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code you care about.\n\nJetpack comprises the androidx.* package libraries, unbundled from the platform APIs. This means that it offers backward compatibility and is updated more frequently than the Android platform, making sure you always have access to the latest and greatest versions of the Jetpack components."
